Crystal Collector

Developed by Ben Tommerdahl using HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, and CSS.

Getting Started
Look at the random number above the crystals and try to match that number to the total score by clicking on the gems.  The gems hold a hidden value at the start of each game.  The values will remain the same until the game is over.  If you match the score, you win.  If your score goes over the target score, you lose.  A new game will start shortly after.  Good Luck!!
